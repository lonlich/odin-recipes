    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (24 oz) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the
            meat is browned. Drain any excess fat. Add the marinara sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for
            15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, salt, and
            pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of
            a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place 3 noodles on top. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then
            top with 1/3 of the meat sauce and 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers twice, ending with mozzarella
            cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25
            minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
